Any insights or experiences you could share would be greatly appreciated.\n    \n      Thank you!""},{""reviews"":""A teacher friend of mine, white American, flew from Shanghai to Los Angeles this weekend. He does not use Reddit, so I am relaying his story. Customs or Border Patrol or whoever has guns in American airports, other than regular Americans who forgot that they cannot bring guns into the airport normally, stopped him as he was getting off of the plane and took him to a room to ask questions including “Why were you in China as an American citizen,” “Are you affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party,” and “Are you exchanging sensitive information with family members or other contacts in the United States that could put America at risk”.\n    \n      He first said, “Dudes I teach science to ninth graders, half of which do not care at all about being there” which apparently was not the right answer. They then asked him if at any time he taught Chinese state-issued doctrine to include loyalty to the party and aggression against the United States. “Not really a science thing, so no,” he said. They took his passport and phone without asking him to surrender these items, where he sat for over two hours alone without any indication that anything was happen. Three different officers returned him his phone and passport and let him go, with one saying to remember his loyalty to the United States.\n    \n      Last year I would have thought that it was bullshit. This year, this is not the first or tenth laowai going back home getting stopped and bullied by the government of their own nationality. Meiguos beware, hostility awaits if you “go home.”""},{""reviews"":""Okay so we all know the slurping, burping and spitting part of China. No one loves it.\n    \n      Are there any ways that Chinese people find foreigners impolite?\n    \n      One person mentioned gift giving and acceptance and refusal customs.\n    \n      I noticed you get a plastic glove to eat your burger and a strange look if you don't use it.\n    \n      Please enlighten me""},{""reviews"":""Hi All,\n    \n      I’m traveling in China at the moment (it’s been a blast so far!)\n    \n      Some of my friends back home are first responders, mainly fire & rescue. They like to collect t-shirts and hats from fire departments when they travel.\n    \n      Does anyone know if it’s possible to visit a fire station here and do something like that? Or are they gonna look at me and think I’m crazy lol\n    \n      I’d settle for shirts or hats from a market store, but I’ve not seen something like that yet nor would I know where to go. Going to be in Chongqing for the next few days.\n    \n      Any advice would be sincerely appreciated. Thank you!""},{""reviews"":""So i am going back from China today and In the border control they took me aside and said i stayed in China 91 days when its only 90 days. Spoke in Chinese and told them I been counting the months not the days and thought i had to leave before tomorrow, got left with a warning. I have got admitted to a University in China and will apply for my X1 Visa end of June, will this be a barrier for me of obtaining my X1 visa?""},{""reviews"":""Dear China,\n    \n      It’s been a while. I mean, I’ve been here a while—over 12 years now. And lately, I’ve felt the urge to share.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      Chapter 1: I Wasn’t Supposed to Be Here\n    \n      Were any of us supposed to be here?\n    \n      I was supposed to be a lawyer. Or at least, that’s what my undergrad and postgrad degrees in law were supposed to lead to. But like many of us, I stumbled into the TEFL world—temporarily, I thought.\n    \n      My first job was with EF (collective sigh), teaching kids. And oddly enough… I liked it. I liked them. I came to China with the vague idea of learning the language. So I went all in—24/7 immersion. Mornings were spent in language classes (I paid for all levels—yes, even the advanced ones I barely understood). Afternoons and evenings were with my students, squeezing every ounce of Chinese into our interactions. Nights? I’d fall asleep to Chinese radio, hoping the language would seep into my brain by osmosis.\n    \n      It worked. I passed HSK 4 within a year, HSK 5 by 2015. People now say I speak Chinese fluently, though my friends say I sound like a British colonial officer barking orders—cheers for that.\n    \n      And all this was happening while broke and drunk from nights out in Shanghai. EF paid me 11.5k RMB/month after tax, minus a housing “allowance” that somehow came out of the salary - WTF? Net: 7.5k/month. Plus I owed a 2.5k “loan repayment” for the first four months which helped pay the deposit for the room that EF didn’t help me find. So basically, I was at zero. I lived off street noodles and free club nights for foreigners. I continued to study rain or shine but mostly just hungover - same as uni really.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      Chapter 2: The Boomerang\n    \n      Eventually, I went home. TBMBH - the big move back home - or was it? I tried the “real job” thing. Only managed to land gigs with Chinese companies doing uni placements for students, using my so-called language skills. Newsflash - maybe learning Chinese doesn’t make you rich or end up giving a hopeful Laowai a big break. It just makes you slightly worse at Chinese than the many hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese that are better qualified than you in jobs requiring Chinese language ability.\n    \n      I missed China. And I missed who I was when I lived there.\n    \n      So I came back.\n    \n      In 2017, I met a woman online during a business trip. We didn’t even meet in person then—we were both too busy. But I told her I’d quit my job and move to Beijing. The first day we met in person (at Arrivals in Beijing Airport) was also the day we moved in together, in Beijing.\n    \n      Yep, we did that and married a few years later.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      Chapter 3: Burnout, Xiamen, and Reinvention\n    \n      Unemployed, bank balance at 20k RMB a relatively low amount but the most I’d ever had up to that point, and feeling burned out, I told my then-girlfriend (now wife) that only two cities could heal me: Xiamen or Kunming. Beautiful cities that I’d travelled to before.\n    \n      Xiamen chose us.\n    \n      And it worked. Within two years, I’d healed, taken on a bunch of new hobbies - Catan, a racquet sport, cycling, soccer and hiking - most of all hiking. I worked at a government school, then moved to an international school. Got qualified as a teacher and started to build a life.\n    \n      But then she got an offer—well, a partnership opportunity—in Shenzhen. She wanted to start a school there with a business partner. I didn’t want to go. I loved Xiamen and didn’t love the idea of going back to Shenzhen (I’d lived there during my EF years - my second and final EF year to be precise).\n    \n      But I went.\n    \n      That same week, she found some job boards for international schools. I applied on a whim. The day I officially got certified as a teacher, I got hired at a top international school—and I’ve been there ever since.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      Chapter 4: From 20k RMB to a lot more\n    \n      Remember how 20k RMB used to be the most I’d ever had?\n    \n      My first paycheck at the new school was 26k RMB after tax and I got 2 of those before I’d even started teaching classes - what is this life that international teachers have? When the money hit my account I thought they’d made a mistake. I was so used to getting paid in the months after services rendered. Since then: raises, promotions, free housing for 7 years, paid flights home, and many other perks. My wife and I have saved almost 500k RMB, and approaching $350k USD including investment growth. Most of the money was saved by me as her business sometimes breaks even but other times can pay the grocery bills.\n    \n      Satisfaction? I only have the quiet satisfaction of being able to provide security for my family along with the calmness of middle age, a calmness that I didn’t have in my 20s. It’s strange to be better off than you once were. People talk about life changing amounts of money but it’s not life changing until you change your life with it.\n    \n      We just had our first child. I plan to take some time off soon—to be a dad, to reset and live a little. Maybe explore western China in our SUV (which we paid cash for) with my wife, kid, and three dogs. Maybe read more, build stuff with my hands and breathe some fresh air. We’ll see.\n    \n      But China… I’m still here.\n    \n      Thanks for everything.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      TL;DR: Came to China in 2013 to teach, fell in love with the language and after a short while, a local, stayed for 12 years. From broke TEFL cliché to certified international school teacher with a family, three dogs, and $350k+ in investments. Planning a sabbatical soon. Still love this weird, wild ride.""},{""reviews"":""I posted a couple days ago about how I was having one of these days where you can't seem to deal with a lot of things that you witness on the daily. I think maybe it also comes from the fact that it's demo classes season and that I have to go through at least  10 of them every week. My school invites kids from nearby schools and we have to perform the same soul crushing class over and over again... I think this has an impact on my mental health, which hasn't been great lately.\n    \n      I have yet another live class in about half an hour. No kids, just two teachers and a camera, and we pretend to be teaching kindergarten kids that are not even in the classroom with us. How do you guys deal with that sort of stuff?\n    \n      I need to vent...can't avoid being negative sometimes""},{""reviews"":""hey!! im going to be in china next month for about 20 days. i know wechat pay (and alipay) are the dominant payment methods and i set up wallet for wechat, but is there any way for my family to send me money to use while im there?\n    \n      i dont really want to use my foreign credit card if i have rmb at my disposal already. otherwise id be paying in cash which i know is pretty uncommon nowadays. i had my mom try sending me some hongbao on wechat but it said it wasn’t supported internationally.\n    \n      please help!! thank you so much!!""},{""reviews"":""Just arrived in China and I’m honestly shocked by how frustrating many of the major apps are. Here are a few examples:\n    \n        \n      \n      Didi doesn’t allow you to link a mainland China bank card with Chinese ID (confirmed by Didi customer service, see comment and screenshot below).\n    \n    \n      \n      Alipay won’t let you change your default bank card unless you first unbind and then rebind all cards (solved, see comments by users below).\n    \n    \n      \n      Baidu Translate hits you with ads the moment you open the app.\n    \n    \n      \n      China Unicom’s app is flooded with promotions and pop-ups—even if you just want to check your data usage.\n    \n    \n      \n      WeChat takes about 5 seconds to load, showing a pointless animation of the Earth from space before it opens. More here: https://www.reddit.com/r/China/s/Alo8yC5wul.\n    \n    \n      \n      Amap/Gaode Maps doesn’t let you rotate the map to align your walking direction with the top of the screen.\n    \n    \n      \n      Why do so many apps use images to display text? Images use more data to transmit than plain text, which slows down the app, and they also make it impossible to copy or translate the content using tools like WeChat’s built-in translator.\n    \n    \n      \n      UPDATE: More observations from comments below:\n    \n        \n      \n      8. When you open Baidu Maps to, for example, quickly find the nearest hospital, you are first forced to watch a 5-second JD.com ad with text embedded in an image on the loading screen.\n    \n    \n      \n      9. Open Taobao and tap the search box—you are immediately hit with half a dozen pop-up promotions one after another. Very convenient.\n    \n    \n      \n      10. On Android, WeChat stores all user data in the app's internal data folder instead of the cache folder. That means you can not clear cached files without either deleting your account data or manually deleting old conversations.\n    \n    \n      \n      11. Your banking app showing a pop-up promotion every time you open it—just to make a transfer or check your balance.\n    \n    \n      \n      12. Some Chinese websites look like they have not been updated since the Windows 95 era, which makes even the current apps feel polished by comparison.\n    \n    \n      \n      13. Try to order a coffee from Luckin via their app and you will have to close half a dozen of pop-up ads before you could complete the order. And in many locations, the app is now the only way to order—there is no in-store alternative.\n    \n    \n      \n      14. Chinese apps drain battery excessively. While in China, a phone’s battery drains nearly 2x as fast compared to using \""Western\"" apps at home. Either the apps are super poorly implemented in terms of background usage / request polling etc., or they have some sort of constantly running “observation” features on (mic, gps, etc). No wonder power bank rental stations are required everywhere here.\n    \n    \n      \n      15. One year of WeChat usage takes up more storage than 15 years of WhatsApp—despite using WhatsApp roughly 9x times more frequently.\n    \n    \n      \n      16. The QQ browser shows a 10-second ad every time you open it.\n    \n    \n      \n      How do people in China put up with this? Am I missing something or are we foreigners too stupid to appreciate the importance of seeing multiple ads and pop-ups every time we open an app. Does my phone need to have at least 1 TB of storage to accommodate all the gigabytes of junk that the well designed Chinese apps are storing in my phone phone? Also, any suggestions or solutions to these issues would be greatly appreciated.\n    \n      UPDATE:\n    \n        \n      \n      I was wrong about point #2 — you can set your default card by adjusting the payment priority order: go to Pay/Receive > three dots (top right corner) > Payment Priority Order.\n    \n    \n      \n      Regarding point #1; I contacted Didi customer support, and they confirmed that you cannot bind a Mainland Chinese bank card in the DiDi app unless you have a Chinese ID card. (I posted a screenshot of my conversation with the Didi customer support in one of the comments below.)""},{""reviews"":""I got a tax refund after my first year in China.\n    \n      But apparently, they can't transfer the money through my bank.\n    \n      My employer helped me with this by taking me to the local income tax office. They checked my details, banking app, and bank card, but for some reason, encounters a problem while transferring it to my bank card. I had a similar issue with linking my bank card with Wechat pay. But it works perfectly fine with Alipay, Wise money transfer (which i use for student finance), ATM cash withdrawals, and so on. There's no issue with my bank account (we went to my bank branch to check, everything was normal).\n    \n      Any idea if I could get my tax refund back by any other means lol?

The Colosseum in Rome was actually in ruins by the middle ages and had to be significantly rebuilt during the premodern and modern era. This is especially true for tourist attractions in East Asia - China, Japan, and Korea where wood was the primary building material but wood only last several centuries. Thus, they have to replace the wood over time (either replace the wood in premodern times centuries ago or more recently in the last 1-2 centuries).\n    \n      Japan's famous tourist attraction Himeji Castle was originally built in 1333, was rennovated with new materials several times over the centuries and then abandoned in the 1800s. It was left to decay and then bombed in 1945 during WW2 where what was left was heavily damaged. So most of the modern Himeji Castle you see today was rebuilt in the 20th to 21st century - however, it was rebuilt with traditional building techniques and materials resembling that of the original construction. Another example is Japan's Ise Grand Shrine that is rebuilt every several decades with new wood...making it an entirely modern construction.\n    \n      The main difference is modern China has a notoriously bad reputation for rebuilding/reconstruction historical artifacts/buildings. In Japan, reconstructionists might use wood, stone, and building materials similar to the original construction, some Chinese reconstructionists use concrete that doesn't remotely resemble the original building materials. For example, when trying to reconstruct parts of the Ming era Great Wall, some Chinese reconstructionists used concrete instead of brick and stone. This resulted in parts of the wall that looks jarringly out of place.\n    \n      So basically everybody reconstructs and repairs their historical sites with \""new\"" building material, but modern China often does a bad job at doing so by often not using the material that resembles the original materials used in construction.\n    \n      Edit: I see that other people are given extremely overly simplistic (if not flat out incorrect) answers blaming all of this on the Cultural Revolution.\n    \n      The Cultural Revolution did not destroy the Tang Dynasty Daming Palace in Xian that OP is talking about. The Tang Dynasty palaces (Daming Palace) in Xian were destroyed many centuries before the modern era. The ruins and archaeological site of the Tang Dynasty Daming Palace weren't even discovered until the 1950s-1960s.

Yes, as I suspected, the difference lies in the culturally specific approach taken towards “authenticity” when it comes to historical sites.

That’s what we, in Europe, would go out of our way to see when traveling lol. I’m so glad they didn’t turn it into yet another Disneyland-like tourist attraction with fake Han decorations.\n    \n      The thing though is, while it is indeed true that there’s a cultural difference, this still doesn’t convince me that these reconstructions are 100% authentic, even if I were to adopt the average Chinese traveler’s mindset. If they were accurately rebuilt according to our latest archeological understanding of the past, then that would be an authentic experience… But what I saw was basically a stereotyped image of the past, probably informed by TV shows and by laypeople’s expectations.

There are also large 20km stretches of the old wall at Jiankou and much further west of Beijing. These walls have been in the original state for at least 400 years.\n    \n      For the all the complaints about authenticity, it's probably best to keep the 'authentic' off the beaten track sites as untouched for as long as possible. Imagine 100million domestic Chinese tourists now walking along collapsed rubble all wanting to take a brick home. The annual restoration required annually would probably cost more than the park fees.""},{""reviews"":""It’s not just China. South Korea and Japan are similar. Although their reconstructions are at least done in a less obviously modern way.\n    \n      Conservation in the west has changed and evolved over time, there used to be a lot more restorations and reconstructions. We now focus on preserving and conserving what’s there and not filling in the blanks with our best guesses. But that’s the style in most of Asia. It’s not less authentic necessarily it just prioritises different end goals. In the west we want to do the least amount of intervention to stop stuff from disappearing forever, and we provide information panels and guides and stuff to show what things may once have looked like. In Asia they prioritise giving a picture or an experience of what things once used to be like. They choose a snapshot in history to recreate. It’s not meant to mistaken for the real thing necessarily, but it is meant to give visitors a real experience. It’s also why so many of these historical tourist sites in Asia (especially Korea and Japan) rent out relatively accurate historical costumes for visitors to wear as they explore the snapshot of history that has been recreated.\n    \n      I would challenge you to look at it less like a caricature, and more like Trigger’s Broom. In the classic British sitcom “Only Fools and Horses” the character of Trigger (played by Roger Lloyd-Pack, perhaps more famous as Barty Crouch Sr. in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire”) is a slightly slow on the uptake but good natured street sweeper. In one episode the local council he works for gives him an award for using the same street sweeping broom for 20 years. They applaud him for being so frugal and saving the council money by taking good care of his tools. In his acceptance speech he mentions that over the years his broom has had 17 new heads and 14 new handles over those 20 years. Of course that means that no part of the broom is even close to 20 years old. But culturally and to Trigger it’s still the same broom. Those modern reconstructions you see are really more like Trigger’s Broom than a cheap copy.\n    \n      Even in conservation here in the UK we still use the Trigger’s Broom model. It’s especially useful in the conservation of early 20th century historical vehicles (tanks and planes mostly) from WWII. The educational and cultural value of seeing a still operational WWII tank or Spitfire plane outweighs the loss of certain parts and components that inevitably have to be replaced in working machinery of that age. A lot of the engine components in those planes and tanks for example are not the original components. But even without it being a “perfect” artefact of history it can teach us more about the time in which it served than it could as an immobile fuselage in a museum.\n    \n      As an archaeologist generally (and a conservator specifically) when I first visited China I was a little disappointed too when I realised that rather than preserving ruins they had opted to reconstruct them. It was just a knee jerk emotional response, I couldn’t help it. It was very much as you described for me as well. But because of my training as a conservator I was able to see, on reflection, that in China and most of the rest of Asia their goals for conservation aren’t necessarily any better or worse, just different. This allowed me to appreciate Chinese historical sites in a new way. And it’s also useful to know that the same happens in reverse. Chinese tourists here in the UK are often a little disappointed to see that many of our famous castles and monuments are in a carefully stabilised and conserved ruinous condition, rather than what they’re used to back home.\n    \n      Anyway, I hope my professional knowledge and my own experiences travelling have helped. I actually ended up doing two different month long trips in China. On the second trip I visited several of the places I had visited the last time again, only this time I approached them with a different mindset and expectation. And I found the experience to be far closer to the magical experience I had anticipated before my first trip. Xi’an is especially dear to me for that reason.
