The hair is super soft, the lace melted beautifully with hardly any effort, and the hairline is so natural – I barely had to do anything to get it ready to wear. It’s definitely beginner-friendly but still looks premium. What really surprised me was how quickly it arrived – I’m in the UK and shipping was much faster than expected. The wig fits comfortably and stayed secure all day. It’s easily one of the best wigs I’ve bought.

The colour is a gorgeous dark to light brunette ombre. The lace is undetectable, and although I had a bit of a struggle trimming around my ears, I'm very happy with the final result. She's a lovely full voluminous wig, and super long, which is what my heart wanted. Something close to my bio hair, which I miss dearly since being diagnosed with Alopecia Areata earlier this year before my 40th birthday.

Since we had intense email communications about it. I’ve purchased several wigs from Hairvivi and feel compelled to share my experience. One of the wigs started shedding excessively after only a couple of wears and two washes — to the point of developing bald spots within less than three months. Despite proper and experienced care, the hair began falling out due to loosened knots, which clearly points to a manufacturing defect.

When I contacted Hairvivi’s customer service with video proof and documentation, they offered a “repair” service for an additional $500 — for a product that is clearly faulty. This is completely unacceptable. As a European customer, I expect basic consumer rights and product quality standards to be respected, but Hairvivi shows no willingness to take responsibility.

Even my newer wig (""Charlotte"") is shedding heavily at the lace, and all four of the units I’ve purchased show similar issues. I am highly experienced in wig care and maintenance, and I can confidently say this is not user error, but a serious quality issue.

Hairvivi’s lack of support and refusal to offer a reasonable solution is incredibly disappointing.

The hair is super soft, the lace melted beautifully with hardly any effort, and the hairline is so natural – I barely had to do anything to get it ready to wear. It’s definitely beginner-friendly but still looks premium. What really surprised me was how quickly it arrived – I’m in the UK and shipping was much faster than expected.

This is the first wig that I've tried on out of the box and thought it was completely PERFECT!

I've been wearing hair due to alopecia for about 10 years and have tried many different styles and brands of wigs. I have a small head and this fits me so well. The color is so beautiful, with subtle highlights and a balayage effect from medium brown roots to dirty blonde tips. It's the closest to my natural hair color with highlights that I've ever seen in a wig. It's my new favorite piece! The hair is longer than I thought it would be, which is a wonderful bonus. I think they measure the length from the nape, rather than the crown, like some other wigmakers do. The density is usually too much on these long wigs but in this case, it's so perfect and natural.

The hair is incredibly soft, full of volume, and has a natural luster that looks just like real, healthy hair.

The pre-plucked hairline and pre-bleached knots made installation so easy — I barely had to do any customization! The lace melted beautifully into my skin, and the fit was absolutely perfect right out of the box. It’s lightweight, breathable, and so comfortable that I almost forget I’m wearing a wig.

I’ve received countless compliments and people literally cannot tell it’s a wig. It’s that realistic! I’ve worn wigs from many top brands, but Hairvivi has officially become my #1 go-to from now on.

Customer service was outstanding too — they kept me updated throughout the shipping process, and the packaging was so luxurious. You can tell they really care about their customers.

KI,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/649c2ab42906af0012f12974,Kim,DK,•,5 reviews,"Apr 23, 2025",https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-5.svg,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6807d8e5ba16cfc165e7cd5c,"Victoria 26"" Medium Cappuccino","I wanted to share my review of the very first human hair wig I’ve ever bought. After some intense researching and deep diving, I chose Hairvivi and the Victoria model in a 26” length.

As this was a pretty pricey purchase, I had several questions regarding the wig. Things like sourcing of the human hair, the density etc, all of which customer service was quick to answer. The 26” was not in stock on their website, but customer service made it available for me to purchase and gifted me a bang accessory to compensate for the extra manufactoring time.

I placed my order on March 4th 2025 and the shipment was sent on March 12th. It arrived exactly one week later. I’m in the EU, so I had to pay customs VAT of 40 USD. Because this was my first purchase, I used the welcome discount code and got 40 USD off my purchase. I also ordered during Women’s Day, so I got a wig Starter Kit added to my order as well.

Be aware you can’t apply more than one discount code. That means that if you have redeemed a free gift, you won’t be able to get it with the same order.

When the wig arrived, I was absolutely enamored with the feel and the smell of the hair. The feel of human hair is so much different from the cheap, synthetic wigs I have from Amazon, there’s really no comparison. The unboxing was a treat in itself and the accessories were a nice added bonus. The wig was beautifully preplucked and the knots bleached. The length of the wig was actually much longer than 26”, more like 30 or 32 inches! I specifically wanted a very long wig, so this was a great surprise. It also passed the burn test and acted like human hair.

I have a small and pretty flat back of my head, so the wig is actually too big, but the Small would be too tight. You can fix this yourself by sewing the tracks in the wig cap closer together to make it lay more flat against the scalp. YouTube has a lot of great videos. I ended up making my own “hair pad” from a wig cap and some synthetic hair which I put inside of the wig before wearing it. You can also get a custom size if you prefer. Importantly, you always have the option to return the wig, just make sure to not cut the lace or the tags off.

I’ve had the wig for 1 month now. I don’t wear it daily only on occasion and I’ve washed, conditioned and used a flat iron and the wig still looks great, but will of course need proper care. I’d recommend Lab Muffin Beauty Science for scientific and evidence-based tips about hair care. The wig has been shedding a lot less than my synthetic wigs. It still looks really great. I've left the same review on the Hairvivi website including a few pictures. The first photo is from the day of arrival and the last picture is one month after with the bangs attached but otherwise minimal styling.

All in all I’m very satisfied and happy with my purchase and I expect the wig to last for many years. I've learned a lot from this whole experience. Hairvivi’s products and customer service are great and I’ll definitely be using them again in the future.",Date of experience:,"April 22, 2025",Useful,Share,https://consumersiteimages.trustpilot.net/business-units/5be777b095bbdc0001865d4a-198x149-1x.jpg,Reply from Hairvivi,"Apr 23, 2025","Hi,

Since then, placing orders has been a frustrating process. I had to email back and forth for weeks just to try and place an order, and due to the delay, I ended up placing a non-wholesale order directly through their website. I did this because I have two cancer patients urgently waiting for wigs. I placed the order on April 8th—it's now April 18th, and nothing has shipped.

Despite multiple attempts to get an update, the communication has been extremely poor. While the quality of the wigs is beautiful, the company really needs to improve its customer service and shipping process. I'm incredibly disappointed and now actively searching for a new wholesale vendor, as I no longer feel confident in relying on Hairvivi.",Date of experience:,"April 08, 2025","Useful

This is Hairvivi customer service team. Thanks so much for patiently waiting for your order. and so sorry that Wholesale whatsApp has a system problem and is being processed.
Generally, all orders can be finished and shipped out in time. But we are sorry for the delay this time because there was a backlog of orders, which led to your order not being completed in time.
First of all, we are deeply sorry for the unpleasant experience and for the late reply because of the weekend and time difference between us.
No worries, we will try our best to ship your order today and then will update you with the tracking number via email. pls note to check it.
Really sorry for any inconvenience.
Best regards

I suffer from hairloss and tried a lot of wig companies over the years.
I was influenced by many tiktok adds and did a lot of research before from here, because in the beginning all wigs look beautiful till you wash and wear them a few times.
Sure, you have to restyle every wig after you wash it, but this? Oh my lord its still beautiful after a lot of wearing.
the hairline and the coloring is insane. I was never happier with a purchase.
i ordered Vivian and wasnt sure about the color so i reached out to them to change my order. They where so nice about it and delivered with no issue.",Date of experience:,"April 18, 2025","Useful
